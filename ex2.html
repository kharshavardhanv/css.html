    <h1>Oh lord shiva</h1>
   <div id="one"> <p>
    On the white summit of eternity<br> 
    A single Soul of bare infinities,<br> 
    Guarded he keeps by a fire-screen of peace<br> 
    His mystic loneliness of nude ecstasy.<br> 
    But, touched by an immense delight to be,<br> 
    He looks across unending depths and sees<br> 
    Musing amid the inconscient silences<br> 
    The Mighty Mother′s dumb felicity.<br> 
    <br> 
   </div>
   <br>
   <div id="two">
    Half now awake she rises to his glance;<br> 
    Then, moved to circling by her heart-beats′ will,<br> 
    The rhythmic words describe that passion-dance.<br> 
    Life springs in her and Mind is born; her face<br> 
    She lifts to Him who is Herself, until<br> 
    The Spirit leaps into the Spirit′s embrace.<br> 
    <br> 
</div>
